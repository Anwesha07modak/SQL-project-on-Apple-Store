Overview:

Welcome to the SQL Project on App Store! This project aims to provide valuable insights into app sales performance on the app store through comprehensive data analysis. Leveraging SQL for data manipulation and analysis, we dive deep into app categories, ratings, pricing strategies, and user preferences to help stakeholders make informed decisions.

Stakeholder Problem:

Aspiring app developers often face challenges in deciding what type of app to build. They seek data-driven insights to answer questions like:
What app categories are most popular?
What price should I set for my app?
How can I maximize user ratings and satisfaction?

Project Components:

Explanatory Data Analysis:

Structure analysis to identify data issues.
Check for consistency in app data across tables.
Identify missing values and data inconsistencies.
Determine the popularity of app categories.

Data Analysis Insights:

Overview of app ratings, including minimum, maximum, and average ratings.
Analysis of high-rated apps and comparison between paid and free apps.
Insights into app categories with low ratings, potential market opportunities, and recommendations for improvement.
Correlation between app description length and user ratings.
Identification of top-rated apps for each genre.

Final Recommendations:

Recommendations on pricing strategies: Consider charging for apps to enhance perceived quality.
Suggestions for developing quality apps in underperforming categories to address user needs and increase market penetration.
Importance of crafting detailed app descriptions to set clear expectations and increase user satisfaction.
Focus on achieving higher ratings to enhance app performance and user satisfaction.
